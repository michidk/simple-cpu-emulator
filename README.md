Simple CPU Emulator
====

A simple CPU emulator written in Rust.

This is mainly a learning project. The architecture is very simple and completely made up. Some inspiration came from the [6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) chip and the book ["Compiler Design: Virtual Machines"](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783642149085).
